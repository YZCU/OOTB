function [overlap, only1, only2] = calculate_overlap(T1, T2, bounds)
% calculate_overlap  Calculates overlap for two trajectories
%
% The function calculates per-frame overlap between two trajectories. Besides the
% region overlap the function also returns cointainment of the second trajectory in the
% first and containment of the first trajectory in the second.
%
% If the trajectories are not of equal length, then the overlaps are calculated up
% to the end of the shorter one.
%
% Input:
% - T1 (cell): The first trajectory.
% - T2 (cell): The second trajectory.
% - bounds (vector): An optional bounds of valid region where the overlap is calculated.
%
% Output:
% - overlap: A vector of per-frame overlaps.
% - only1: A vector of per-frame containment of the second trajectory in the first.
% - only2: A vector of per-frame containment of the first trajectory in the second.
